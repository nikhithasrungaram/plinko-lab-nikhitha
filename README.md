In building Plinko Lab, my primary focus was on correctness, determinism, and replayability before polish. I chose Next.js 14 (App Router) with TypeScript for the frontend to leverage serverless API routes and seamless integration with the backend, and Prisma with SQLite for a lightweight, reliable data layer. The commit–reveal provably-fair system was implemented exactly as specified, with SHA-256 hashing and a deterministic xorshift32 PRNG to ensure that all outcomes can be independently verified through the /verify page. For physics, I integrated Matter.js to produce smooth, realistic Plinko ball motion while keeping the discrete decisions authoritative to preserve fairness. This balance between physics-based UX and deterministic logic was a key design decision that ensured both credibility and user engagement.

AI (ChatGPT, GPT-5) was used selectively to accelerate boilerplate generation — mainly for scaffolding the Next.js structure, Prisma model setup, and test configuration — while I personally validated, refined, and documented all fairness and PRNG logic. AI also helped in improving UI polish ideas and accessibility features, but all fairness-critical code and mathematical logic were implemented manually. Overall, the collaboration with AI allowed me to focus more on engineering correctness, performance, and UX craftsmanship within tight time constraints — resulting in a project that is both provably fair and visually compelling.
